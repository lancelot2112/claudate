### 🔄 **Implementation Priority Queue**

Based on test failures, here's the recommended implementation order:

#### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Advanced functionality gaps)
1. **RAG System Integration**
   - Missing: `setSearchEngine()`, `setVectorStore()` methods
   - Missing: `CrossStoreQuery` interface
   - Missing: Vector store configuration and setup

2. **AI Integration Testing**
   - Replace mocked tests with real API connectivity verification
   - Add health check testing with actual services
   - Verify cost tracking with real usage data

#### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Integration features)
3. **Agent Coordination System**
   - Task handoff between agents
   - Multi-agent workflow management
   - Load balancing and agent selection

#### **LOW PRIORITY** (Advanced features)
4. **Context Management Enhancements**
   - Advanced compression algorithms
   - Cross-session context preservation
   - Performance optimizations

### 📊 **Test-Driven Development Guide**

The failing tests serve as **executable specifications**. For each failing test:

1. **Read the test expectations** to understand required behavior
2. **Implement the minimum code** to make the test pass  
3. **Verify the test passes** before moving to the next
4. **Refactor if needed** while keeping tests green

**Example**: For `processMessage` implementation, see:
- `tests/unit/agents/PersonalAssistantAgent.test.ts:84-134` (general inquiry)
- `tests/unit/agents/PersonalAssistantAgent.test.ts:136-167` (technical routing)
- `tests/unit/agents/PersonalAssistantAgent.test.ts:169-200` (strategic routing)

### 🎯 **Success Criteria Updates (Post-Phase 5 Enhancement)**

- ✅ **Foundation**: Complete (100%) - **Audit Verified**
- ✅ **Basic Agents**: Complete (100%) - **Corrected After Investigation**

## Implementation Guidelines for Claude Code Agents

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementing functionality
3. **Documentation-First**: Update documentation as you implement
4. **Monitoring**: Add metrics and logging for each component

### Code Organization
- Follow the folder structure defined in README.md
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all agent communications
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for scalability

### Security Considerations
- Never commit API keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
- Validate all input data

### Performance Optimization
- Use Redis for hot data and caching
- Implement connection pooling for databases
- Add proper indexing for database queries
- Monitor and optimize AI API usage costs

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Claudate framework incrementally, with each phase delivering tangible value while building toward the complete vision of an intelligent multi-agent system for executive communication and project management.
